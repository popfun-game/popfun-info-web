  "work_info_text": "<h3>Real-time all-in-one GameFi data board.</h3> <p> Welcome to   <a href=\"/\">pop.fun</a>! This site was founded in Feb 2022 to provide up-to-date token and crptocurrency prices, charts and data about the emerging GameFi markets. We take our data very seriously and we do not change our data to fit any narrative: we stand for accurately, timely and unbiased information.</p><h3>We Provide Live and Historic Live and Historic Crypto Charts for Free</h3><p>Each of our coin data pages has a graph that shows both the current and historic price information for the coin or token. Normally, the graph starts at the launch of the asset, but it is possible to select specific to and from dates to customize the chart to your own needs. These charts and their information are free to visitors of our website.</p><h3>What Is an IGO? </h3><p>IGO stands for initial token offering. Many of GameFi related projects in the crypto space — and individual items from different games  — raised money from private investors around the world in the crypto equivalent of a crowdfunding campaign. Investors would send funds — usually in the form of Bitcoin — to the project and receive tokens in return.</p><h3>Does Pop.Fun list all tokens or cryptocurrencies? </h3><p>No, we do not list all cryptocurrencies at <a href=\"/\">pop.fun</a>. As a company and team, we are very aware that not all coins and projects have good intentions. While we cannot guarantee to exclude them all, we have a vetting process that each token goes through before it is listed on the site. If we suspect that a token or project is a scam, it does not get listed.</p><h3>What Is the Guild? </h3><p>Guild at Pop.Fun refers to GameFi Guild, much like their traditional counterparts, GameFi guilds are an organized group of gamers that often work together in-game to complete missions. </p><h3>What Is the Chain? </h3><p>Chain at Pop.Fun refers to Blockchain .A blockchain is a distributed database that is shared among the nodes of a computer network. As a database, a blockchain stores information electronically in digital format. </p><h3>Which Is the Best token or cryptocurrency to Invest in?</h3><p>PopFun does not offer financial or investment advice about which cryptocurrency, token or asset does or does not make a good investment, nor do we offer advice about the timing of purchases or sales. We are strictly a data company. Please remember that the prices, yields and values of financial assets change. This means that any capital you may invest is at risk. We recommend seeking the advice of a professional investment advisor for guidance related to your personal circumstances.</p><h3>If You Are Investing in GameFi project or NFT —  <a href=\"/\">Pop.Fun</a> Is for You</h3><p>The data at  <a href=\"/\">pop.fun</a> updates throughout the day, which means that it is possible to check in on the value of your investments and assets at any time and from anywhere in the world. We look forward to seeing you regularly!</p>",
